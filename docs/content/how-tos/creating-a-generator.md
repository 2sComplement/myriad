Im sorry there is no step by step guide (Yet) you can use the following as reference until I get around to writing it:

[Applied Metaprogramming with Myriad and Falanx](https://7sharp9.github.io/fsharp/2019-04-24-applied-metaprogramming-with-myriad/)  - This is a video I made for my YouTube chanell which covers some details on Myriad.  


[Myriad Intro](https://7sharp9.github.io/fsharp/2019-11-06-myriad-intro/) - This is a blog post I wrote around the time of Applied Metaprogramming with Myriad and Falanx which has details of making a generator that produces a simple module:
:

```fsharp
module example1 =
    let fourtyTwo = 42
```
