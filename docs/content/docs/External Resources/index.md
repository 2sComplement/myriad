![Generator](pexels-mikhail-nilov-7662853.jpg)

There is currently an introduction to Myriad and a How to guide on creating a simple generator

[Applied Metaprogramming with Myriad and Falanx](https://7sharp9.github.io/fsharp/2019-04-24-applied-metaprogramming-with-myriad/)  - This is a video I made for my YouTube channel which covers some details on Myriad.  


[Myriad Intro](https://7sharp9.github.io/fsharp/2019-11-06-myriad-intro/) - This is a blog post I wrote around the time of Applied Metaprogramming with Myriad and Falanx which has details of making a generator that produces this simple module:


```fsharp
module example1 =
    let fourtyTwo = 42
```
